Web Authentication is a new standard enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users using hardware authenticators.

[WebAuthn.me](https://webauthn.me) contains a visual walkthrough of each step of the process of registering new credentials and authenticating using these credentials. There's also a debugger to play around with different configurations and an introduction page with some more information.
